# AQ-KAN Reproducibility Artifact

This repository contains the official reproducibility artifact for the paper:

**Adaptive Quantum-Inspired Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (AQ-KAN)**

The artifact consists of two Jupyter notebooks that together validate
the theoretical and methodological claims of the paper through
mathematical experiments and unit tests.

## 📂 Contents

- `AQKAN_Mathematical_Experiments.ipynb`  
  Reproduces all experiments from Sections 4 and 5, including:
  - boundedness and stability,
  - robustness under distributional drift,
  - dependency recovery,
  - performance trade-offs,
  - computational scaling.

- `AQKAN_Unit_Tests.ipynb`  
  Verifies key mathematical properties via unit-test-style checks:
  - Lemma 1.1 (state boundedness),
  - Proposition 4 (determinism),
  - Corollary 2.1 (measurement stability),
  - Lemma 2.1 (bounded dependency weights),
  - Theorem 4 (scaling behavior).
